  A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled malformed JPEG images. A
  website containing a malicious JPEG image could cause SeaMonkey to crash
  or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-2377)
  
  Multiple dangling pointer flaws were found in SeaMonkey. A web page
  containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-0083, CVE-2011-0085, CVE-2011-2363)
  
  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-2364, CVE-2011-2365, CVE-2011-2374, CVE-2011-2375,
  CVE-2011-2376)
  
  An integer overflow flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled JavaScript
  Array objects. A website containing malicious JavaScript could cause
  SeaMonkey to execute that JavaScript with the privileges of the user
  running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-2371)
  
  A use-after-free flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled malformed
  JavaScript. A website containing malicious JavaScript could cause SeaMonkey
  to execute that JavaScript with the privileges of the user running
  SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-2373)
  
  It was found that SeaMonkey could treat two separate cookies as
  interchangeable if both were for the same domain name but one of those
  domain names had a trailing &quot;.&quot; character. This violates the same-origin
  policy and could possibly lead to data being leaked to the wrong domain.
  (CVE-2011-2362)
  
  All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
  these issues. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for
  the changes to take effect.";
