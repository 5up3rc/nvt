tag_insight = "USN-1197-1 and USN-1197-3 addressed an issue in Firefox and Xulrunner
  pertaining to the Dutch Certificate Authority DigiNotar mis-issuing
  fraudulent certificates. This update provides an update
  for Qt that blacklists the known fraudulent certificates.

  Original advisory details:
  USN-1197-1
  
  It was discovered that Dutch Certificate Authority DigiNotar had
  mis-issued multiple fraudulent certificates. These certificates could allow
  an attacker to perform a &quot;man in the middle&quot; (MITM) attack which would make
  the user believe their connection is secure, but is actually being
  monitored.
  
  For the protection of its users, Mozilla has removed the DigiNotar
  certificate. Sites using certificates issued by DigiNotar will need to seek
  another certificate vendor.
  
  We are currently aware of a regression that blocks one of two Staat der
  Nederlanden root certificates which are believed to still be secure. This
  regression is being tracked at https://launchpad.net/bugs/838322gs/838322
  
  USN-1197-1 partially addressed an issue with Dutch Certificate Authority
  DigiNotar mis-issuing fraudulent certificates. This update actively
  distrusts the DigiNotar root certificate as well as several intermediary
  certificates. Also included in this list of distrusted certificates are the
  &quot;PKIOverheid&quot; (PKIGovernment) intermediates under DigiNotar's control that
  did not chain to DigiNotar's root and were not previously blocked.";
